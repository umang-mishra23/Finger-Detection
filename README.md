# Finger-Detection
This project detects and identifies raised fingers in real-time using computer vision and deep learning techniques.
The system can accurately recognize which finger is raised, providing interactive feedback for various applications.

Key Features:
Finger Identification – Detects and names the raised finger (e.g., thumb, index, middle finger).
Real-time Detection – Processes live video streams for instant feedback.
Gesture Recognition – Supports multiple finger combinations for advanced gesture tracking.
Technology Stack – Built using OpenCV and Mediapipe for efficient hand landmark detection.
Applications – Useful for touchless interfaces, sign language interpretation, and interactive systems.


Requirements:-
numpy
opencv
